% VTB2
%
% VTB2_1 plots the forced response of an undamped single degree
%        of freedom system to a sinusoidal input.
% VTB2_2 plots the forced response of an underdamped single
%        degree of freedom system to a sinusoidal input.
% VTB2_3 plots the frequency response (transfer) function of a 
%        single degree of freedom damped system.
% VTB2_4 plots the displacement transmissibility ratio and
%        force transmissibility ratio of a single degree of 
%        freedom damped system.
% VTB2_5 plots the displacement and phase of a system with
%        rotating imbalance as a function of frequency.
% VTB2_6 plots the free decay of a single degree of freedom
%        system with viscous, coulomb, or air damping.
%        NOTE: VTB2_6 will be replaced by VTB1_5 after Fall 2000
