%
% VTB1: Free response of single degree of freedom (SDOF) systems.
%   vtb1_1     - plots the free response of a single-degree of freedom
%                system.
%   vtb1_2     - numerically integrates to find the unforced response 
%                of a system using Euler's method.  The system can
%                be in state space or LSOM form.
%   vtb1_3     - performs fourth Runge-Kutta integration on a differential
%                equation.  The equations need not be linear.
%   vtb1_4     - numerically integrates to find the forced response 
%                of a system using Euler's method.  The system can
%                be in state space or LSOM form.
