% VTB9_1 solves for the natural frequencies, damping ratios, 
%        and mode shapes of a linear second order matrix (LSOM)
%        form system.  (M,C,K)
%        NOTE: VTB9_1 will be replaced by VTB4_3 after Fall 2000
% VTB9_2 numerically integrates to find the unforced response 
%        of a system using Euler's method.  The system can
%        be in state space or LSOM form.
%        NOTE: VTB9_2 will be replaced by VTB1_2 after Fall 2000
% VTB9_3 performs fourth Runge-Kutta integration on a set of
%        equations described in a specified file.  The 
%        equations need not be linear.
%        NOTE: VTB9_3 will be replaced by VTB1_3 after Fall 2000
% VTB9_4 numerically integrates to find the forced response 
%        of a system using Euler's method.  The system can
%        be in state space or LSOM form.
%        NOTE: VTB9_4 will be replaced by VTB1_4 after Fall 2000
